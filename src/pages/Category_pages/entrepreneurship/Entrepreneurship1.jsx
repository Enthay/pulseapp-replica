                 <a href="">Jodi Brandstetter</a> is a consultant and serial entrepreneur 
                 with over two decades of recruiting experience. In 2018, she founded a 
                 consulting firm with an emphasis on helping small and mid-sized businesses 
                 in STEM hire better recruiters and talent. But after writing and
                 marketing <a href="">her first book on recruiting talent</a>, 
                 Jodi realized that business leaders across industries
                 needed a streamlined approach to publishing and promoting business books.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Drafting, writing, and editing a book are hard enough. But C-Suite executives 
                 and entrepreneurs then have to source book covers, format their book, decide 
                 on distribution channels, and figure out their marketing plan. It is too easy to get lost
                 in the process and forget about writing and publishing a book altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That’s why Jodi founded <a href="">Influence Network Media</a> in 2021. It’s 
                 a professional community that provides support and services for writing, publishing, 
                 and marketing books for business-leaders-turned-authors.
                 Influence Network Media is more than a passion project—it’s a business in its own right.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We interviewed Jodi on the Cash Flow Show to learn how she started her network business from scratch.

                <h1 className="lefth1">What is a network business?</h1>
                <p>
                 A network business is more than a forum or group, although many successful 
                 network platforms start off this way. Influence Network Media offers a 
                 combination of a free group, paid courses, and “do-it-for-you” concierge 
                 services. The free group provides access to a community of fellow business writers
                 and supporters, while book production services are bundled into packages. 
                </p>
                <p>
                 Setting up a second business with so many social elements can be time-consuming. 
                 For that reason, Jodi decided to bring on a partner. 
                 This would allow her to better balance her consulting
                 business with the network and bring another set of skills into the business.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “I made that decision to find a partner who actually complements me,” 
                 says Jodi. “So I'm more of the Chief Operating Officer, and she is more the
                 business development side. So we work well together in that perspective.”
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">From free to monetized services</h1>
                <p>
                 Inside the free Influence Network Media group, potential clients can ask 
                 questions, interact with Jodi and her team, and meet with other business leaders.
                 This both qualifies leads and gives the group and the network more authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These clients can choose to then buy a guided course to write, edit, publish, 
                 and market their book. Courses start at $799 and help
                 clients figure out the perfect headshot to becoming a bestseller on Amazon.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Jodi outsources to independent contractors for work like design, book editing, ghostwriting,
                 and other tasks. She also coaches authors who want hands-on experience.
                </p>
                <div className="boldquotes">
                 “When I started my consulting business, I started with just a checking account 
                 and a business credit card,” notes Jodi. “And then I added accounts for my 
                 first business over time so that I could bucket my money. I now have one
                 savings account that's just for taxes, and I have another one for a rainy day.”

                <p>
                 The Influence Network Media’s signature offering is a multi-author book service, 
                 which is unique. In this service, an author can choose to take ownership over 
                 one chapter in a multi-author book. This can be extremely useful for influencers who are not
                 ready to write a whole book but still want to expand their thought leadership.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If they want more assistance, potential clients can also choose to contact 
                 her team for a concierge service based on their budget. Jodi and her team will 
                 then locate ghostwriters, cover designers, and other professionals to get the 
                 book finished. The team can also help with market efforts,
                 such as arranging podcast interviews, press releases, and other events.
                </p>
                <p>The list below summarizes services on the Influence Network Media.</p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Create a book summary</li>
                    <li>Write a book for them</li>
                    <li>Coach them on writing a book themselves</li>
                    <li>Help navigate podcasts and guest appearances</li>
                    <li>Design marketing materials</li>
                    <li>Provide bestseller strategy</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Strategic money management between businesses</h1>
                <p>
                 If there’s one thing Jodi appreciates, it’s keeping expenses down. She uses several 
                 inexpensive or free applications to keep meticulous business records. For example, she uses 
                 <a href="">Wave app</a> for invoicing, which is a free application for small businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To keep her business accounts organized, Jodi keeps a separate account for 
                 each business, each at completely different financial institutions. This 
                 makes it easy to separate the accounts mentally and prevents her
                 from using her consulting account for her network business and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “When I started my consulting business, I started with just a checking account 
                 and a business credit card,” notes Jodi. “And then I added accounts for my first 
                 business overtime so that I could bucket my money. I now have one
                 savings account that's just for taxes, and I have another one for a rainy day.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Currently, she budgets about 5% of her income for 
                 emergencies but plans to expand it to 10% post-pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Since Influence Network Media is so new, she only has a single checking account 
                 and credit card. But as the business grows, Jodi plans 
                 to add more “bucket” accounts to separate items like taxes and expenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The biggest tip Jodi has for entrepreneurs? Know your strengths and weaknesses 
                 and reserve your cash for services or tools that complement those weaknesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For example, Jodi says that she’s not nearly as good at creating advertising 
                 and marketing materials as she is at running operations. For that reason, Jodi 
                 prefers to spend on marketing and advertising but handles other aspects of the 
                 company herself, such as accounting, networking, and other high-level tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This cash flow strategy helps her keep a low overhead 
                 and retain more income, without doing everything herself.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Cash flow management should be easy</h1>
                <p>
                 The key to keeping any business healthy and sustainable in the long term is 
                 cash flow. Whether you need to boost your prices, reduce your expenses, hire 
                 help, or build that second business, the best 
                 way to know when the time is right is to look at your cash flow statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For at-a-glance visuals and in-depth numbers, a cash management tool can help 
                 keep you on track. Pulse is a cash flow tracking tool for business owners, built 
                 by business owners. Take your business to the next
