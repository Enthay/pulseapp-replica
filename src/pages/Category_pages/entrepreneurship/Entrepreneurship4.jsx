                 (Read <a href="">this article</a> , and you can thank us later when
                 you decide to sell for $20 million instead of $200 million.)

                <p>
                 In the meantime, as a founder, you’re responsible for paying bills, handling 
                 payroll and keeping the lights on—whether or not you
                 consider yourself a “numbers person” that enjoys fiddling with spreadsheets.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You probably aren’t, and you probably don’t. You probably excel at software 
                 architecture, product development or sales.
                 But your investors will expect to see your cash flow projections from time to time.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When it comes to outside funding, the devil in the details
                 either builds your credibility or hurts it.
                </p>
                <p>So how can you stay on top of your cash flow projections?</p>
                <p>Here are six tips to help you take control of your cash flow:</p>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                     <b>Download a free cash flow template</b>. You can find a 12-month 
                     version <a href="">here</a> and 3-year version <a href="">here</a>. Better yet, use Pulse to give 
                     your projects that professional polish that spreadsheets lack. Pulse 
                     is also better for sharing visual cash flow and collaborating with mentors 
                     and investors. Spreadsheets are perfectly acceptable, of course, but Pulse offers another,
                     more subtle benefit: building trust by showing that you’re savvy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <b>Create your sales forecast</b>. A good rule of thumb is to create
                     three different projections: conservative, moderate, and aggressive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <b>Estimate your expenses</b>. If your business is already up and running, plug in 
                     your past numbers. If you haven’t opened the doors yet, you may have overlooked 
                     certain sneaky, variable expenses like office cleaning, travel, tax work and LLC 
                     fees. It’s those little things that can get you, so sit down with a 
                     veteran entrepreneur. Ask him or her to help you
                     identify likely expenses that you missed and poke holes in your projections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <b>Plug in as much past data as you can–past, present, and future</b>. Fair 
                     warning: This may take you awhile. If you start to go cross-eyed or get 
                     frustrated, come back to the task tomorrow.
                     Ask for help from your accountant. Ask for help from your mentors and advisors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <b>Commit to a monthly review—at a minimum</b>. Pick a day each month, sit 
                     down with your co-founders, and run your actual numbers. Schedule it like you 
                     would any other mission-critical meeting. If you’re not outsourcing your bookkeeping 
                     to <a href="">someone else</a>, then the buck stops with you. Throwing receipts in a shoebox 
                     won’t cut it. Update your actual numbers and compare them to your projections. 
                     Pulse makes this pretty easy; <a href="">this blog post</a> will walk you through the steps. Once you 
                     know where you stand, you can develop a plan of attack and delegate responsibilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <b>Don’t let profits lull you to sleep</b>. Your P&L Statement may look 
                     squeaky clean. But don’t let being in the black deceive you. <a href="">You can be 
                     on budget and profitable AND still be broke</a>. Do you have cash reserves? 
                     Ninety days’ worth of operating expenses is worth considering while you’re 
                     figuring out your <a href="">financial ratios</a>. Are you planning for that unexpected 
                     expense? What about the talented Rails developer who moves on to a 
                     cushier gig? A contractor who fills in
                     may cost you more per hour than your W-2 employee and skew your numbers.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Stay committed to your monthly review. Surprises will come, but you can minimize their
                 impact by staying on top of your cash flow and saving for a rainy day.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Shows like <a href="">Shark Tank</a> and <a href="">Silicon Valley</a> may have glamorized (and
                 poked fun at) the startup journey, but backstage, running a startup is a lot of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Master your cash flow projections now, and we can promise that
                 you’ll make wiser spending and saving decisions in the future.
