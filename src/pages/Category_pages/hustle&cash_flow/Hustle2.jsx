                 Far from Silicon Valley, CEO Vincent Dupourqué and his 10-person team at KOMPAÏ Robotics 
                 design, build and test their latest healthcare innovation in Bidart, a small beachside 
                 town in Southwestern France. The team seeks to solve the problems of nursing homes and 
                 hospitals around the world, which are struggling to
                 provide assistance to the rapidly multiplying number of the elderly and their families.

                <p>
                 With decades of experience in biomedical engineering and general robotics, Vincent started KOMPAÏ Robotics
                 in 2016 to create a solution to this crisis with a robot designed to help caregivers and patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Although their robot focuses primarily on assisting caregivers, Vincent and his team must 
                 work out a specific problem: how it will interact with multiple people with different goals, 
                 including the caregiver, the patient, and the patient’s family. The KOMPAÏ also functions as 
                 a companion robot, built to help seniors monitor their health, talk with friends, family, 
                 and their doctors, and even walk.
                 In other words, these robots can also help the elderly to maintain their autonomy longer.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Developing a complex product</h1>
                <p>
                 “The biggest challenge is that robots can do anything,” says Vincent. “We had to 
                 define a few functions that make sense. This meant we churned out 20
                 to 30 prototypes to eventually reach something that made sense for the end-user.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 The engineers at KOMPAÏ Robotics test it at multiple hospitals and nursing homes 
                 in the region. They don’t just test for functionality, but for emotions. Using focus 
                 groups at hospitals and other nursing homes, they have been able to define the size of
                 the robot, its global appearance, functions, and make it acceptable to all users.

                  <i>
                   KOMPAÏ can remind patients of when to take their medicine and how much to take,
                   call for help in case of an emergency, and collect and store healthcare data.
                  </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now in its third model, you can find the KOMPAÏ at EHPAD Adarpea, a nursing home only 
                 ten minutes away from the team’s workshop. During lunch, this robot roams the cafeteria, 
                 showing a film or playing music on its screen to promote conversation among the elderly 
                 residents as they wait for their meal. This same machine can take a stroll with residents, 
                 allowing them to use it for support without the hassle of pushing the machine. For the nurses 
                 and other caregivers, KOMPAÏ can remind patients of when to take their medicine and how much
                 to take, call for help in case of an emergency, and collect and store healthcare data.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When COVID-19 became a concern, KOMPAÏ adapted to the crisis. They created an alert to
                 remind users to wash their hands and take other health precautions to prevent the spread.
                </p>
                <p>
                 KOMPAÏ version 3 is approaching the end of its testing phase. But the journey has been 
                 a long one. When you look at KOMPAÏ’s current selection of healthcare-based robotic caregivers with huge
                 human-like eyes and a touch screen, it’s hard to look back at where this dream began.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Vincent started his journey towards biomedical engineering in 1975 at the Université 
                 de Technologie de Compiègne. When he joined the SPARTACUS project and developed a robot 
                 for quadriplegics, he found it both interesting and motivating. 
                 But shortly after his studies, he had to stray
                 from healthcare robotics and pivot into industrial and military robotics engineering.

                  <i>
                   Looking back: For his PhD, Vincent developed a system to robotize and control a wheelchair with
                   head, for quadriplegics. The same head device was also used to control the SPARTACUS robot.
                  </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                 “The reason for shifting into general robotics was very simple. During the 
                 80s and 90s, there was no money available for healthcare robotics.
                 All of the funding and research went into military and industrial pursuits.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 In 1985, Vincent co-founded Robosoft, where he made a breakthrough in robotics. 
                 Robosoft designed and created the first mobile robot called the roboTER. Think 
                 of it as an earlier version of robotic sweepers, square and compact, with the 
                 ability to handle hundreds of pounds. As one of the first mobile 
                 robots dedicated to research, traces of the
                 roboTER can be found in hundreds of other robots made by Robosoft and KOMPAÏ.

                <h1 className="lefth1">Balancing passion & finances</h1>
                <p>
                 The dedicated engineers continued to develop and refine their robots. From robots 
                 that cleaned floors, vacuumed, fueled tanks to autonomous shuttles and unmanned 
                 ground vehicles. Their decades of research in robotics eventually
                 allowed them to engineer robots that drive Vincent and the company today: The KOMPAÏ.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “At the beginning of the 2000s, we understood we had two directions where we could 
                 make robots that helped people. First was that we could continue with autonomous vehicles for transport.
                 The other was to create robots that would help solve the aging crisis in Europe."
                </p>
                <p className="boldquotes2">
                 “The problem we wanted to address is that by 2050, 10 million caregivers will be 
                 missing while the number of seniors will double. This means that 
                 the number of people depending on caregivers will
                 be four times what it is now, while the number of caregivers will remain the same.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                 Studies show that by 2050, the number of elderly people needing long-term care will 
                 likely double. But the economic drawbacks to an aging population will come much
                 sooner. Increasingly larger generations are entering the stages of senior citizenship.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The state of care will offer its own set of issues. Seniors will need intuitive devices 
                 to keep them in touch with their physicians, family, and friends. Mobile devices can do 
                 some of the legwork, but these smaller gadgets
                 are regularly updated and don’t have as much functionality as a full-on caregiver.

                 In order to make KOMPAÏ a reality, Vincent and his team at KOMPAÏ Robotics must 
                 balance their time between their main goal and other contracts. This is because 
                 like any other business, but more so in a company that requires research and copious 
                 amounts of testing, Vincent must find ways to finance the research. One way is to 
                 continue taking on contracts that relate to their specialty: autonomous vehicles. 
                 Three or four days of the workweek, the team meets in the office to focus on their 
                 robots and robotic consulting. Their main bread and
                 butter are the military defense robots, mainly off-road and all-terrain vehicles.

                   Vincent has been able to dedicate four people from

                 However, since they recently received funding from the European Commission through 
                 the organization’s Horizon 2020 program to work on KOMPAÏ, Vincent has been able to 
                 dedicate four people from their 10-person team to work full-time on the project. To 
                 gain access to this program, KOMPAÏ joined a larger initiative focused on solving 
                 the aging crisis in Europe with industry and policy
                 called SHAPES. This multinational collaboration is set to last until October 2023.
