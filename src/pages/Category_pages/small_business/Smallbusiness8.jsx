                 I have a friend who runs a small landscaping business. During the winter 
                 months, he turns his attention from mowing and pruning to clearing snow 
                 and assisting homeowners in winterizing their property. 
                 He also takes a vacation during one of the winter months,
                 as opposed to the busy summertime when his services are in higher demand.
                </p>

                 Many businesses see more or less consistent cash flow throughout the year, but for 
                 others, seasonal peaks and valleys are a way of life. Whether your business has 
                 seasonal products, accounting, logistics or changes in the amount of work you 
                 receive from your clients, learning to predict and manage these fluctuations 
                 is crucial to business sustainability. Fortunately,
                 you can take steps to minimize losses during these periods of inconsistent revenue.
                </p>
                <p className="small">You can take steps to minimize losses during periods of inconsistent revenue.</p>
                <p style={{color: "#080c16", marginBottom: "8px"}}><b>Cash Flow is Predictable</b></p>
                <p>
                 The first and most important thing you can do to understand your slow 
                 periods is to accurately monitor and forecast cash flow. With a correct 
                 and consistent prediction of seasonal lulls, you can take
                 action to reduce the impact of these valleys on your annual bottom line.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Forecasting cash flow for a seasonal business is the same as for a year-round b
                 usiness, but actually more predictable. While all businesses must contend with 
                 the normal fluctuations of revenue and expenses, seasonal businesses will have 
                 an easier time estimating revenue in the off-season (particularly if the 
                 business is closed in the off-season). Expenses during this interval can become
                 very predictable indeed, especially if they are cut down to the bare necessities.
                </p>

                <p style={{color: "#080c16", marginBottom: "8px"}}><b>Ways To Reduce Loss</b></p>
                <p>There are at least three ways to brace your business for seasonal lulls:</p>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                     Spend less money during these slow months by communicating with
                     vendors (possibly reducing payment terms to keep cash in the business).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     Cut unneeded spendings such as subscriptions, equipment rentals,
                     or services that can be temporarily suspended.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     Reduce labor force during slow periods. This may not be a 
                     viable option for all small businesses, however, particularly those
                     with a small number of employees (perhaps even just one.)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                 A better alternative is to diversify goods and services offered during 
                 the off-season. This way, you’re not just lowering expenses but you’re 
                 bringing cash back into the business. For example, a self-employed 
                 photographer who specializes in wedding photography would look for 
                 other avenues of income during the slower months, such as photography 
                 for holiday cards, “save-the-dates”, or creative projects
                 they might not have time to explore during the busy wedding season.
                </p>
                <p style={{color: "#080c16", marginBottom: "8px"}}><b>The Key Is Planning</b></p>
                <p>
                 And the best way to plan is to carefully watch and forecast your cash flow 
                 and expected projects. This way, your small business can save some of the 
                 cash on hand from your profitable months to offset your expenses during 
                 slow months. This is where Pulse comes in handy. By comparing to previous 
                 periods of low demand, you can have a reasonable idea of how much
                 revenue to expect from their customers. (Or, what revenue to not expect.)
                </p>

                 Pulse is an excellent tool to help give you the knowledge
                 you need to keep your seasonal business moving forward,
                 even when there’s less fuel to keep the engines running.
