                 Cash flow problems keep many business owners up at night.
                 That's why we wrote these little bedtime stories to help you rest easy.
                </p>

                  <b>The Princess Meets Her Prince, Sir Line-O-Credit</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                 After establishing a track record of success and profit, many businesses 
                 work with a bank to secure a line of credit. Businesses may want a line of 
                 credit in case they find themselves waiting on a big check, but they may also 
                 take advantage of it if there's an opportunity that's too good to pass up, such as acquiring a
                 competitor or investing in a new technology that will grow their business.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's the thing, though: banks want to give you money when you don't need 
                 it, so be sure to get your line of credit when things
                 are going well. A month's worth of expenses is a good amount to shoot for.

                  <b>The Frog Gets Kissed By Online Payments</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sometimes, your cash flow can be quickened by simply allowing 
                 your customers to pay you online. Many invoicing
                 platforms have online payments built in. Here are some of our favorites:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                   <li><a href="">Harvest</a></li>
                    This is what our parent company, Simple Focus, is
                    currently using to track time and send invoices. It's super easy to use.
                    <li><a href="">Freshbooks</a></li>
                     This is what Simple Focus used to use. It's great for small, growing
                     businesses who want to look professional and streamline invoicing.
                     <li><a href="">Quickbooks Online</a></li>
                      Yuck, right? As an industry giant, we have to include them, and they
                      did just redesign their online product (it's actually not that bad).
                      <li><a href="">Less Accounting</a></li>
                      We're friends with these guys and Simple Focus designed their logo.
                       They have super friendly customer service and a recently redesigned product.
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>There are other great options out there, too. These are just the ones we've used.</p>
                <p style={{color: "#080c16", fontSize: "20px", marginBottom: "8px"}}>
                  <b>The Knight In Shining Armor Gets Paid In Advance</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Another way to improve cash flow is by reducing your receivables. Regardless 
                 of what you've been told, it's entirely possible to negotiate for upfront 
                 payments in the service industry. On larger projects, you can still break payments
                 into milestones, but put them in front of the work rather than behind it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And yes, big companies are willing to negotiate their payments terms,
                 even with small businesses. You won't get it if you don't ask for it.

                 Sometimes, we all just accept that wasted expenses are a part of business. 
                 But, we don't have to accept that. One of the most obvious ways to improve 
                 your cash flow position is to look for places where you
                 business is spending unnecessary money and simply stop spending that money.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One quick method is to go down your credit card and bank statements and look 
                 for recurring fees for things you don't use any more. In addition to this 
                 super simple method, there are also some great tools
                 for automatically analyzing your expenses. Here are some of our favorites:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Mint</a></li>
                     Mint ties in to your bank accounts and visualizes everything very
                     nicely and shows you where you spend your money based on categories.
                     <li><a href="">Personal Capital</a></li>
                      This company lets you connect your bank and investment accounts as 
                      well, but they also have financial advisors who are relentless about 
                      trying to help you out. They're interested in helping you with your 
                      entire portfolio, so if you're looking to do a little financial
                      planning in addition to managing your cash flow, check them out.
