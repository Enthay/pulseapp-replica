                <p>
                 <a href="">Greg Marano</a> of <a href="">The Syracuse Pen</a> loves teaching seventh-grade English, but he wanted to
                 use his writing skills more. So in 2015, he decided to try his hand at freelance writing and editing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When he started freelancing and marketing his skills, he wasn’t looking at niching 
                 into resumes. But as he spoke with more and more people, Greg realized that there 
                 was significant demand for resume writers. It wasn’t long before he decided to
                 specialize in writing compelling resumes and helping his clients land their next job.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In our recent episode of the <a href="">Cash Flow Show</a>,
                 Greg shared his insights on running a side hustle while maintaining a full-time job.

                <h1 className="lefth1">Balancing a full-time job with a side hustle</h1>
                <p>Juggling a job and a business isn’t easy, but Greg has a sustainable system that makes time for both.</p>
                <p>
                 Greg attributes much of his success to the fact that he’s been teaching for 
                 13 years and has a strong support system in his full-time job. Not only does 
                 he have years of lesson plans to draw from, but he can share and streamline his ideas with co-workers.
                 Thanks to his experience, he’s been able to create an ideal work environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 At school, he can focus on his students and grading papers.
                 This lets Greg dedicate his time outside of school hours to freelancing.
                </p>
                <div className="boldquotes">
                 “That's because school is my bread and butter. And I really, really enjoy it so 
                 that has to take priority. But I plan it in such a way that I make the most
                 use of my school time for school, so I have most time at home for the business.
                </div>
                <p>
                 His freelancing hours are filled with client calls, analyzing resumes, 
                 and writing projects. On the rare occasion he has to bring home
                 school work, Greg has the flexibility to turn off his side hustle.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “If we’re starting something new or we have a big project at school, I'll 
                 turn off the Google ads, or let new clients know that there's a longer 
                 timeframe than usual,” says Greg. “That's because school is my bread and 
                 butter. And I really, really enjoy it so that has to take priority. 
                 But I plan it in such a way that I make the most use of
                 my school time for school, so I have most time at home for the business.”
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Finding Clients</h1>
                <p>
                 When you have limited time to spend on your side hustle, one struggle is 
                 finding out how to get clients. Originally, Greg started out on Upwork, 
                 a marketplace for service providers and businesses to connect. And 
                 while that’s still a useful platform, he has since expanded
                 into using advertising channels and personal referrals for attracting clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Word-of-mouth referrals are by far the most effective means of getting 
                 clients. After all, people trust a friend or coworker over an ad. But 
                 Greg also leverages organic LinkedIn traffic and Google Ads, which he 
                 can turn on and off depending on his budget or workload.
                 This provides him with a low-cost avenue to find high-quality clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “I look at my ads and discover which forms are bringing me the best revenue,” says Greg.
                 “The ones that attract the most reliable and frequent customers are the ones I reinvest in.”
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Organizing multiple sources of cash flow</h1>
                <p>
                 It’s fairly common for business owners with two income sources, especially 
                 two active businesses, to get expert financial advice. While Greg keeps a spreadsheet of his general cash flow,
                 he employs an accountant to help him prepare taxes and keep track of expenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This allows him to get expert financial advice and focus more on what matters—writing for his clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But that doesn’t mean that Greg isn’t keeping an eye on his cash flow. 
                 With a full-time job teaching, the pressure to grow his business’ revenue 
                 isn’t as intense as it is for other ventures, but he still likes to keep
                 tabs on his business finances and ensures that he maintains a low overhead.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As a freelancer specializing in writing, overhead is generally low. 
                 Most of Greg’s finances fall into the category of advertising 
                 or professional memberships, such as the <a href="">Better Business Bureau</a> and 
                 the <a href="">National Resume Writers Association</a>.
                 He also keeps some money aside for computer upgrades or repairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Greg occasionally uses cash flow projections but doesn’t
                 lean on them. Why? He usually outperforms his projections.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “It's hard to project because the business is still growing. And 
                 it's grown every year since I started,” says Greg. “Every time I've 
                 made a projection, I've always gone well past it. So if I were to make a projection,
                 I usually find that I'm projecting a little too conservatively.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Manage cash flow for all of your businesses with one click</h1>
                <p>
                 Greg has a lot on his plate, but he gets it all done
                 thanks to organized business operations and finances that he keeps simplified.
                </p>
