                 Your grandparents were onto something – small cuts now can add up over time and 
                 turn into significant savings. Take Warren Buffett’s famous frugality. Though 
                 his net worth exceeds <a href="">$65 billion</a>,
                 Buffett still lives in the home he purchased in 1958 for <a href="">$31,500</a>.

                 As you dig into your own spending habits, you may discover needless 
                 expenses that can add up over time and impact your bottom line.
                 Here are five common ways you could be wasting money without realizing it.
                </p>
                <p><b>1. Brick-and-Mortar Office</b></p>
                <p>
                 You may have a killer office space, but have you seen clear evidence that those 
                 pretty hardwood floors lead to more signed contracts? Businesses like <a href="">Happy Cog</a>
                 have transitioned to a distributed office, and they are still just as effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In fact, the <a href="">latest research shows</a> that half of all employees will work from 
                 home by 2020. If giving up your office is an option, you can work with your 
                 team by using technology like Skype, Slack and
                 Google Hangouts and rent a conference room when you need to meet face to face.
                </p>
                <p><b>2. Sneaky Charges</b></p>
                <p>
                 Do a quick review of your monthly expenses (and make sure they're all 
                 accounted for in Pulse). Maybe that membership to PRWeb made sense in the
                 early days, but there are plenty of other ways to get your name out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Look at your regular expenditures and think about which ones haven't made a meaningful 
                 impact on your business in the past six months. Here are some of the usual suspects:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Software subscriptions</li>
                    <li>Professional groups</li>
                    <li>Web services</li>
                    <li>Domain registrations</li>
                    <li>Subscriptions that auto-renew</li>
                    <li>Magazine subscriptions</li>
                    <li>Extra phone lines</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                 When you sign up for a new membership or service, set a reminder in your calendar 
                 for six months later. If you haven’t
                 seen the value that you anticipated, cancel your account before it auto-renews.
                </p>
                <p><b>3. Find Everyday Discounts – Without Cutting Coupons</b></p>
                <p>
                 Look for proactive ways to save by considering switching to other companies 
                 that offer better deals on the products or services you’re using. Let’s say 
                 you spend $50 a month in bank fees. If you switch to a new bank that offers 
                 free checking, you could save $600 a year. Look for other ways to save by 
                 bundling services (like your internet and
                 phone services) or getting discounts for setting your bills to auto-pay.
                </p>
                <p><b>4. Pass Along Costs</b></p>
                <p>
                 Chick-fil-A’s average per-store grosses were $3.18 million in 2012. Sure, 
                 it was their pleasure to serve you,
                 but those profits came from a significant markup on the cost of raw materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Think about one of your standard projects and total up all of your recurring 
                 costs. If your expenses come out to $900 per job, tack $900 onto the project 
                 total. Revisit your profit margins, and you may discover
                 that you can save money by passing the costs on to your clients or vendors.
                </p>
                <p><b>5. Difficult Clients</b></p>
                <p>
                 There’s one more thing that isn't going to show up on your bank statements – difficult 
                 clients. Do you have a client that calls at night? One who always pays late? A 
                 know-it-all who talks down to you and bullies your team? Maybe it’s time to 
                 fire the bottom 20 percent of your clients (or at least the worst one). What you lose in cash
                 you’ll make up for in morale and the newly acquired freedom to land better clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When you find creative ways to cut unnecessary expenses,
                 you’ll have more cash on hand to invest in your future.
