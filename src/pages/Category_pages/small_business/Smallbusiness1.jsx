                 <a href="">Justin Green, CFP®, MSPFP</a> is a fiduciary financial planner who helps business owners and
                 self-employed professionals manage their money. But it wasn’t always that way.
                </p>
                <p>
                 After four years of working at a traditional retirement planning firm, Justin 
                 decided he wanted to work with his peers rather than retirement-age clients. 
                 He enjoyed engaging with Millennials, Gen Xers, and Gen Z savers,
                 and he knew there was a huge financial planning gap for those younger generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In late 2020, he decided it was time to go out on his own and start Assist 
                 FP, a virtual financial planning firm. In starting his own business, Justin doesn’t just talk about cash
                 flow and business finances, he’s experienced all the ups and downs himself.
                </p>

                 his advice for small business owners, entrepreneurs, and independent contractors.

                <h1 className="lefth1">5 Cash Flow Tips for the Self-Employed</h1>
                <p>
                  Justin helps families in traditional full-time jobs and self-employed 
                  individuals plan their financial futures. As a result, he understands 
                  the temptation to overlap personal and business expenses and the challenges 
                  associated with keeping business finances separate. Once you 
                  begin using personal accounts for business or vice
                  versa, it becomes very difficult to effectively manage business finances.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “With self-employment, personal cash flow and business cash flow sometimes
                 are commingled and so it's very important to get them to separate those,” says Justin.
                </p>
                <div className="boldquotes">
                  "A lot of people avoid the numbers because they're scared of what it's going to tell them"
                </div>
                <p>
                 Commingling is just one of the problems that Justin has frequently come across 
                 in his work. Here are five more actional
                 tips business owners and contractors can implement today for better cash flow:
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1" style={{fontSize: "36px", fontWeight: 700, letterSpacing: ".2px"}}>
                1. Focus on the numbers
                </h1>
                <p>
                 Surprisingly, the most common issue that Justin
                 notices is that most entrepreneurs don’t want to look at the numbers at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “A lot of people avoid the numbers because they're scared of what it's going to 
                 tell them, so they might feel that tension that something isn't making sense with the cash flow
                 or things are super tight or their expenses are clearly higher than their income.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 However, the only way to find a businesses’ pain points is to get an overview of the
                 cash flow. That’s where Justin starts when organizing business finances.
                 Once an owner sees the numbers, it’s much easier to make data-driven business decisions.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1" style={{fontSize: "36px", fontWeight: 700, letterSpacing: ".2px"}}>
                  2. Don’t make plans based on assumptions
                </h1>
                <p>
                 Whether you are planning for retirement or estimating where your business 
                 will be in five years, it’s easy to make assumptions based on your current consumer base.
                 Instead, Justin suggests keeping projections more current and short-term.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “For example, I try not to do a lot of retirement projections for Millennials,
                 because so many assumptions would go into a projection and it just wouldn't be accurate.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Instead of looking too far into the future, it’s more beneficial 
                 if individuals focus on meeting short-term goals around long-term business processes.
                 The important thing is to be continually moving towards your goal.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1" style={{fontSize: "36px", fontWeight: 700, letterSpacing: ".2px"}}>
                 3. Be aware of expense creep
                </h1>
                <p>
                 As a business grows, it’s easy to take on more expenses. Often called “lifestyle creep” 
                 in personal finance, the same principle
                 applies to business spending. Spending can rapidly become a problem if left unchecked.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Justin usually directs his clients to the business model in <a href=""><i>Profit First</i></a> by Mike Michalowicz 
                 to help with cash flow. Business owners need
                 to have a system that allows them to “take profit first” to ensure proper cash flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Normally, a business subtracts its expenses from its income to find the 
                 profit. In the “profit first” method, businesses should account for profit before adding in expenses.
                 What is leftover after your profit can be used for business operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “Of course, if your cash flow situation is not very great, then it's 
                 going to be a very small profit at the beginning.
                 But once you get in the habit, that profit will grow,” comments Justin.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1" style={{fontSize: "36px", fontWeight: 700, letterSpacing: ".2px"}}>
                 4. Have an effective accounting system
                </h1>
                <p>
                 Keeping personal and business finances separate is critical for efficient 
                 accounting. Justin recommends having multiple bank accounts, one each for taxes, 
                 expenses, and profit. This type of virtual envelope system makes it easy to track
                 expenses and income while also ensuring that the business sticks to its budget.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1" style={{fontSize: "36px", fontWeight: 700, letterSpacing: ".2px"}}>
                 5. Save for taxes ahead of time
                </h1>
                <p>
                 Planning for taxes ahead of time can help you accurately plan 
                 your cash flow and lower your stress. Simply keeping that money aside
                 in a separate account can give you peace of mind every quarter.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “It’s best to save 15-20% per month from their income for taxes and 
                 set it aside,” says Justin. “So when their tax
                 bill does come quarterly, there’s no stress about where to pull it from.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 The simpler and more streamlined the process is, the easier it is to pay the IRS and handle any potential audits.
                 At the same time, you can rest easy knowing that your taxes are taken care of.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Organizing Your Cash Flow Efficiently</h1>
                <p>
                 As Justin has pointed out, business success begins with cash flow. Whether 
                 you are a solopreneur, the founder of a startup, or a small business owner, tracking
                 your financial health can fuel informed business decisions that grow your company.

                <div className="lefth1">More Insight From Justin On How He Built His Business</div>
                <p>
                 Justin doesn’t just offer advice to other business owners and entrepreneurs—he
                 shares in the hardships of creating a business from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Justian explained that there were two essential points he needed
                 to focus on to create a solid financial base for his business:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pricing for the Millennial market</li>
                    <li>Factoring compliance expenses</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1" style={{fontSize: "36px", fontWeight: 700, letterSpacing: ".2px"}}>
                 Pricing for Millennials
                </h1>
                <p>
                 Justin chose from two business models to set his pricing. The first and more 
                 common model was a brokerage practice, which is commission-based. While the advice is free
                 for the client, the advisor is paid by a third-party to push their products.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The second option was to act as a <a href="">fiduciary</a> and bill the client directly. 
                 A fiduciary financial planner is someone who is legally bound to put the client’s best 
                 interest above all else. This type of advisor is not allowed to work on commission and 
                 is paid directly by the client with a fee. Most traditional fiduciaries take a flat 1-2% 
                 percentage fee for assets under
                 management (AUM), which is the total value of your individual investments.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Rather than model his pricing structure entirely on the traditional percentage fee,
                 Justin added one-time advising packages and a subscription as his primary offering.
                </p>
                <p>To meet the needs of Millennials and Gen Z, Justin has three core offerings:</p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>a 2-session financial planning offer with a single fee</li>
                    <li>a subscription for ongoing financial planning and advice</li>
                    <li>a percentage fee add-on for investment management</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                 This pricing structure allows him to provide tailored services to younger clientele no matter where they are
                 in their saving journey. It also helps Justin better serve self-employed individuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For example, with the subscription model, Justin can help advise with cash 
                 flow analysis, debt management, and tax planning, along with their personal 
                 savings needs. But a young couple looking to buy their first house won’t need such a
                 robust plan. So they may choose to invest in his two-session package instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “Because I’m working with younger clients, there are definitely different 
                 stages of life when we are working together and sometimes they need some basic advice,”
                 says Justin. “Different subscriptions allow me to help younger clients.”
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1" style={{fontSize: "36px", fontWeight: 700, letterSpacing: ".2px"}}>
                 Keeping Track of Expenses
                </h1>
                <p>
                 While Justin is able to keep his expenses fairly lean, being a fiduciary 
                 comes with compliance requirements, such as keeping permanent client files 
                 with all communication and planning materials, making backups and copies of 
                 all marketing materials in case of an audit, and ensuring that clients are 
                 given written policy documentation. Most of his business expenses go towards 
                 essential compliance or planning software such 
                 as <a href="">Advice Pay</a>, a payment processor that allows him to
                 stay compliant with his billing practices and review his projected revenue.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Cash flow projection has been an important piece of the puzzle from the very 
                 beginning. With a clear window into his finances, Justin can better track his 
                 income and expenses. The most useful feature for him is to be
                 able to toggle different dates in the future and forecast his potential earnings.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “That's extremely helpful for me because, as I continue to grow, that projected 
                 income is based on ongoing subscriptions that I already have set up,” notes Justin.
                 “That allows me to see when I can start to outsource some tasks to other professionals.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Justin tends to stick with three-month or six-month projections, and then use that information
                 to plan potential business investments, such as hiring contractors for marketing.
                </p>
