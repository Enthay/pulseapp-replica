                 While there are many uncertainties for businesses during and after COVID-19, 
                 one thing is clear: Many businesses need to change or risk failure. By the 
                 end of March,<a href="">60 major retailers</a>—with more than 50,000 physical 
                 retail locations— had closed temporarily and a survey from Main Street America 
                 concluded that <a href="">7.5 million businesses</a> were at risk of permanent closure. While consumers are
                 spending less overall, they are buying up to <a href="">30% more online</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As more and more states <a href="">allow businesses to reopen</a>, albeit, with nuanced 
                 restrictions, it’s not quite business as usual. In order to stay afloat, many small 
                 businesses had to innovate and find a way to survive in this new normal. 
                 From shifting <a href="">online</a> to readjusting their
                 <a href="">cash flow</a>, business owners have drastically changed their operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Going forward, business owners will have to continue to strive to find 
                 new ways to connect with consumers on increasingly
                 tight budgets. The good news? There are many creative methods to consider.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">1. Rethink delivery</h1>
                <p>
                 The key to survival for businesses is ensuring cash flow into the business. 
                 This alone has driven companies to find ways to continue to serve customers 
                 despite lockdowns. For retail shops, this can mean turning to eCommerce or 
                 curbside pickups. For restaurants, this has resulted in taking
                 online orders, increasing takeaway meals, or offering home deliveries.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Consumers are likely to be on guard and less interested in going out. 
                 So the easier you can make the delivery, the better. Not only is this 
                 approach customer-focused, but it will reduce foot traffic at your physical 
                 location without sacrificing revenue. For businesses required to operate at 25% or 50% capacity,
                 changing up how you deliver your final product can level the playing field.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For those concerned with handling limited capacity, you can consider 
                 creating a pre-paid reservation system to make everything run smoothly. 
                 <a href="">Black Sheep Restaurant</a> in Hong Kong has created a <a href="">COVID-19 Playbook</a>
                 that details all of their procedures from delivery to cost management.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">2. Embrace the digital world</h1>
                <p>
                 For many retailers, adding an <a href="">eCommerce</a> option can 
                 allow them to move inventory, increase cash reserves, and reconnect with customers.
                 But opening an online store isn’t the only way to boost cash flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Events that might have been held live on location can be turned into exclusive live 
                 streams. Take online fitness lessons as an example. Many fitness businesses, such as 
                 <a href="">Downtown Yoga</a> in Memphis, Tennessee, have turned to virtual sessions 
                 to revive their revenue streams. For other service-oriented businesses, you can offer
                 free or discounted consultations through <a href="">Zoom</a> or <a href="">Skype</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Expanding your digital marketing plan is another way of using social 
                 distancing to your advantage. You can invest in content marketing 
                 with blogs, email lists, and outreach on social
                 media to bring more awareness to your business and promote deals.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">3. Create unique, reoccurring offers</h1>
                <p>
                 COVID-19 has altered <a href="">consumer behavior</a>, and even as business appears 
                 to return to normal, this new mindset will likely stick around. 
                 Stockpiling and seeking out savings are and will continue to be top 
                 priorities for your customers. How can you rearrange your
                 business model to appeal to this mindset? There are a few options:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Memberships</b></li>
                     Create a custom, reoccurring package to ensure long-term cash 
                     flow while providing customized service. Using a subscription 
                     model, you can offer a certain amount of meals per week, exclusive 
                     perks like free monthly products, or form partnerships with 
                     other businesses to provide unique packages. Since memberships are an ongoing service,
                     this is an excellent way to stabilize your business income.
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Gift cards</b></li>
                     If you can’t reopen right away or you're waiting on new inventory, 
                     you can allow your customers to buy gift cards—online or offline, 
                     even at a discounted rate. Providing this option
                     gives you some immediate capital without sacrificing service.
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Renting</b></li>
                     Instead of relying on sales, is it possible to rent your products? While 
                     this may require extra sanitization efforts when items are returned, 
                     it can be an excellent revenue source. Like the membership option, 
                     renting out equipment or products can provide a regular revenue stream 
                     while you reorganize. Owners of <a href="">Cyclebar East Cobb</a>, a cycling studio in Marietta, Georgia,
                     allowed customers to rent stationary bikes to stay fit during the lockdown.
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">4. Ask consumers what they need</h1>
                <p>
                 Don’t forget, you can always survey your community to discover new ways 
                 to pivot. Do this by connecting with your customers, employees, and 
                 suppliers through social media or even just calling them. One example is 
                 <a href="">Lively Run Dairy</a>, where the owners realized that they could 
                 buy excess milk and make cheese to donate to food banks, rather than let 
                 farmers dump it. They turned to <a href="">GoFundMe</a> to help fund their
                 idea — and it worked. Within a day they had met their goal of $20,000.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Simply keying into consumer wants and needs during this time can help you
                 discover new ways to stay connected and retain customers—even if you aren’t breaking the bank.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Working towards recovery</h1>
                <p>
                 COVID-19 is pushing businesses to evolve faster than ever, and by the time 
                 stores officially reopen, it’s likely consumers will have become accustomed 
                 to a more virtual—and more personalized—experience. Many of the solutions 
                 that will help you stay in touch with your customers
                 are not only short-term measures but can become long-term revenue streams.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Before you can decide which path is right for you, <a href="">evaluate your cash flow</a>
                 so you’ll have a clear understanding of where you can afford to spend.
