                 Thanks to COVID-19 and social distancing, small businesses are revising their 
                 business strategies with new ways to maintain stability.
                 For many, that has meant turning their brick-and-mortar operations towards eCommerce.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Despite the fact that between <a href="">80%-90%</a> of consumers expect a recession 
                 in the upcoming year, Americans are spending up to <a href="">30% more through</a> online 
                 shopping. In the USA alone, retail online revenue
                 has <a href="">increased by more than 100%</a> compared to the same time last year.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The fact is, eCommerce is quickly becoming a viable—if not necessary—income stream for 
                 businesses worldwide. For example, Carmel City Center, a downtown shopping destination 
                 in Carmel City, Indiana, recently <a href="">developed an eCommerce site for its 
                 tenants</a> to help them keep selling. One of their tenants,
                 a floral shop called Rusted Window, now receives 70% of their orders from the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But how can small businesses pivot into eCommerce—and do so
                 quickly—with budget constraints and uncertainty?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Keep reading for everything you need to know to successfully add eCommerce to your business strategy.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1"><br /></h1>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Evaluate your resources</h1>
                <p>
                 If you’ve never sold online before, understanding what is required matters more than 
                 ever. In addition to setting up a virtual shop (and a website if you don’t already have 
                 one), you’ll need to plot out your
                 current cash flow and possibly find a functioning manufacturer and a shipment method.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you haven’t already, you should reassess your financial resources 
                 and <a href="">adjust to the crisis</a>. Understanding your financial state 
                 not just for now—but five, eight months down the road—will help you decide
                 not only the best eCommerce platform for you but also how you can market online.
                </p>
                <p>
                 While spreadsheets are useful, a cash flow management software will save you time and allow 
                 you to model out different scenarios—so you can see what each option will actually cost your 
                 business. For example, you can quickly plug in how expected income and expenses from running 
                 an eCommerce shop would affect your
                 bottom line. This will be crucial when you are trying to decide how you want to sell online.
                </p>
                <p>
                 After you’ve looked at your cash flow, it’s important to look at the offline mechanics. 
                 Domestic shipping methods aren’t seeing drastic <a href="">interruptions</a>, but if you previously 
                 worked with an international manufacturer or supplier, you may need to look into 
                 negotiating a contract with a local provider. Otherwise, the purpose of setting up a
                 shop will be to get rid of as much inventory as possible and keep the cash flowing.
                </p>
                <p>Beyond Google and local references, some domestic supplier and manufacturer databases are:</p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Kompass</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Thomasnet</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">MFG</a></li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Once you understand your limitations in terms of inventory and capital,
                 you can focus on the next piece: What should you sell?
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1"><br /></h1>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Decide your selling strategy</h1>
                <p>
                 COVID-19 hasn’t just increased online shopping, it’s changed it. You don’t just
                 need a niche—you need to align your business with high-selling products.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Baby products, sports and fitness equipment, beauty products, and grocery items 
                 have become popular eCommerce items. Even if your business is not related to these 
                 industries, is there a way to link your product to something 
                 else that is selling? Would it be possible to create
                 a partnership with a company that sells these products to create unique packages?
                </p>
                <p>
                 And it’s not just product popularity that has shifted—generations also differ 
                 when it comes to spending online. For example, <a href="">54% of Millennials</a> say 
                 that the pandemic has affected their spending —compared to 33% of Baby Boomers. Depending on
                 your consumer base, you may need some extra buzz to encourage customers to buy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You may want to consider creating items exclusive to the online store or providing 
                 discounts for larger orders. If you’ve already modeled out your cash flow, you can
                 better define how much of a discount you can give without taking on a major loss.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1"><br /></h1>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Set up shop</h1>
                <p>
                 Once you know what you plan to sell—you can finally focus on setting up your eCommerce
                 site. There are really two options, and they depend on your current financial situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For those just starting up and already have low capital, it may be better to start 
                 with a third party platform that only takes a slice of the sale compared to a monthly 
                 subscription—such as Amazon, Etsy, or eBay. You may even be able to arrange orders on 
                 Facebook for pickup delivery if you’re really low-tech. 
                 For businesses using WordPress, <a href="">WooCommerce</a> is technically
                 a free solution—with optional paid extensions—that is relatively easy to set up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But if you have a bit more wiggle room, you can sign up with a proper eCommerce 
                 platform so you can have a branded store. This can mean setting up shop with 
                 comprehensive platforms like <a href="">Shopify</a> or <a href="">BigCommerce</a>, 
                 both of which charge a $29/month fee for their basic plans. For smaller
                 businesses, <a href="">Squarespace</a> and <a href="">Square Online Store</a> offer more affordable 
                 plans at $18 and $12 dollars a month respectively. The Square Online Store also offers a free eCommerce
                 site option—but you can’t remove the Square branding and has limited features.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Setting up your own store might take some extra time to launch, but you 
                 will have complete ownership over the website while providing secure access 
                 to payment portals, gift cards, and more. Shopify also makes it easier to sell on social media,
                 which allows you to add Instagram, Facebook, and Amazon as sales channels.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1"><br /></h1>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Market with empathy</h1>
                <p>
                 While more people are spending, building trust is more important than ever. Consumers 
                 have plenty of questions—how is your shipping
                 affected? How are you keeping conditions safe? Do you accept payment installments?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Take ten to twenty minutes to layout a COVID-19 FAQ to help customers cope and build trust in your brand.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Once that’s finished, you can focus on your products. If you already have a digital 
                 marketing plan— such as social media management or blogging, it may be time to expand 
                 it. When creating your marketing
                 material, focus on trust-building and educating rather than promotional content.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One way to do that is through listening and interacting with customers 
                 on <a href="">social media</a>. Platforms like Facebook have seen a 70% increase 
                 in usage in March alone. Rather than focus on ads, you can also use contests to 
                 drive engagement. For example, GoPro launched its #HomePro challenge with a chance 
                 to win a camera and a 5-year subscription to its Plus service. And there are plenty 
                 of free tools to help out, like <a href="">WooBox</a> for
                 contests and <a href="">TweetDeck</a> to monitor discussions and hashtags on Twitter.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As you chat online with your customers and research competitors,
                 it will be easier to find ways to connect and soft sell.
                </p>
                <h1 className="lefth1"><br /></h1>
                <h1 className="lefth1">Keep moving forward</h1>
                <p>
                 After setting up your eCommerce website, you can continue to monitor your sales 
                 and its influence on your business. Since the economy is still in a state of flux, 
                 your business will constantly be changing. You may need to realign your marketing approach or add
                 another eCommerce channel, such as selling both on your own website and Amazon.
                </p>
                <p>
                 While there’s no guarantee eCommerce will be your main income stream during or after the
                 pandemic, it may help keep your business afloat and provide an extra layer of stability.
