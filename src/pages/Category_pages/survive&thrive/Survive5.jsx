                <p>Stop me if you’ve heard this before:</p>
                <p>
                 “I got into the agency business because I’m passionate about
                 the craft. I don’t really know much about the business side of things.”
                </p>
                <p>Or how about this one:</p>
                <p>“I landed the biggest customer ever, and now my business is going under.”</p>
                <p>Or this:</p>
                <p>“We have tons of work coming in. Everyone is crazy busy, but we’re losing money.”</p>
                <p>
                 I have said each of these things out loud, and my business managed to survive. To 
                 survive in business, you need to use common sense and understand one thing: cash flow 
                 management. In an effort to refresh my own memory, and to help you out, I’d like to share
                 six business killers that I have somehow managed to survive over the past seven years.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I won’t point out specifics, but I have struggled with each of these business killers. 
                 I have seen each of them take down business owners close to me. It sucks, and it hurts. But all of
                 the owners have recovered and are now back on their feet—wiser for the experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hopefully, this straight talk can save you some heartache and keep you from
                 making the fatal mistake of not actively managing your cash flow.
                </p>
                <p><b># 1 – Paying Yourself Too Much</b></p>
                <p>
                 Before I hired the first employee at my <a href="">UX agency</a>, I was a freelance 
                 web designer. As a solo practitioner without any practical business experience, I 
                 thought “profit” was how much money I took out of the business
                 bank account and put into my personal bank account. But that isn’t quite right.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For a solo practitioner, profit is what your business makes after you pay your
                 company’s bills and pay yourself a fair market rate for your line of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To grow from a freelancer into a small agency, and then from a small agency into 
                 a mid-sized agency, your business needs to make more than
                 you need to live on before you can safely hire additional people to help you out.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Though that seems obvious, many of us take extra cash out of the business 
                 prematurely. Cash finally starts flowing nicely, so you decide to pay down
                 some debt or treat yourself to a new car, nicer clothes, or a home renovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with that! Just be very clear on how you define
                 profit and make sure your business has some money that you don’t touch personally.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Profit should go to keeping your business finances healthy, not just your personal finances.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Fix: On the 1st and 15th of each month, pay yourself as little as you can. What 
                 does someone with your experience and skills make working for someone else? That’s 
                 what you should pay yourself. Then, at the end of each quarter, after you pay your 
                 tax installment and keep profit in the business, consider drawing
                 some extra cash out of the business and putting it in savings or buying something nice.
                </p>
                <p><b>#2 – Not Re-Investing Profits</b></p>
                <p>Question: Who wouldn't spend $10 to make $20?</p>
                <p>Answer: The person without $10.</p>
                <p>
                 When you get the $10, double down on your business. Cash in the bank doesn’t grow as 
                 much as money that’s being put to work. When you have extra cash on hand, 
                 you can operate your business at a loss (for
                 a bit) in order to invest in new opportunities and still maintain a healthy business.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Planned growth is expensive. You must have cash on hand
                 so that you can spend money now to make more money in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Fix: I’ve <a href="">chosen to buy cash flow stable SaaS businesses</a> with the 
                 profits from Simple Focus, which helps to regulate the ups and downs of agency 
                 project cycles. Find ways to reinvest your
                 profits in growing your business, reducing risk, or improving your quality of life.
                </p>
                <p>Here are four examples:</p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Hire a sales director, executive assistant, or production staff.</li>
                    <li>Lease or purchase new equipment and add to your capabilities.</li>
                    <li>Buy out competitors or buy a book of business from someone making a career transition.</li>
                    <li>Add new products and services to your lineup.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>#3 – Unexpected Growth</b></p>
                <p>
                 Growth is expensive, but unexpected growth can cripple your business before you know 
                 what hit you. Very healthy cash flow is the foundation that
                 can get you through. It enables you to rapidly put a load-bearing structure in place.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If a very large opportunity shows up at your doorstep, evaluate it with a critical 
                 eye. If you scale up your operation to support the opportunity
                 and then that opportunity goes away in a year, would you have to let people go?
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Fix: Consider a route less risky than immediate, full-time hires, such as 
                 independent contractors or partnerships with companies that can supplement your
                 capabilities. You could also refer the work to someone else for a 15% referral fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you do take on the project, start looking now for new customers to help you 
                 diversify your risk. Your largest customer should account for no more than 30% of 
                 your business. Use the opportunity to grow your business to
                 a new level, but think ahead about what happens to your cash flow in a year or more.
                </p>
                <p><b>#4 – Slow-to-Pay Customers</b></p>
                <p>
                 Big companies have big budgets, notoriously long payment terms, and long, complex contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To avoid these problems, smaller agencies will often work as a subcontractor for a 
                 preferred vendor doing work for a large company.
                 If that vendor’s contract with you has a we-pay-you-when-we-get-paid clause, watch out.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If your customer—that is, the big company’s vendor—doesn’t have a healthy
                 business, then they may choose to catch up on other bills before paying you.
                </p>
                <p>You wait even longer.</p>
                <p>
                 Large companies pay slowly for logical reasons. They have a significant amount of 
                 cash on hand at any given time, but if it’s sitting in a bank account, it’s not 
                 growing. So instead of holding this
                 cash, they invest it to grow it. The longer they hold the cash, the more they make.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Inflation also comes into play: a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in 60 days.
                 If they pay you $10,000 in 60 days, as opposed to today, they’re paying less for your service.
                </p>
                <p>Ouch.</p>
                <p>
                 The Fix: First off, charge more when you work with really big companies to make up for 
                 the payment terms, complexity, and additional layers of management. And secondly, pay 
                 an attorney to walk you through your
                 agreements. Don’t sign anything that doesn’t guarantee that you get paid for your work.
                </p>
                <p><b>#5 – Cash Flow Lulls</b></p>
                <p>
                 You can make gobs of profit over the course of the year,
                 only to be brought to your knees by a summer cash crunch.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The thing about cash flow management for agencies is that there are really intense 
                 project cycles, and then there are slow periods. You need cash on hand
                 for the slow periods because your payroll and rent don’t stop when business slows.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Fix: Work out payment plans and negotiate vendor agreements so that you reconcile 
                 your accounts payable and accounts receivable. During the wet season of big projects, 
                 you can lay up cash reserves. When you have
                 three months of operating expenses in the bank, a summer dry season won’t starve you.
                </p>
                <p><b>#6 – Employees Quitting</b></p>
                <p>
                 Sometimes, when an employee quits, you feel nothing but relief. Maybe 
                 he wasn’t a good fit, and he sensed the bad fit before you could act
                 on it. Maybe you’re happy to keep the extra cash from his salary.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But more often than not, an employee’s departure hurts both emotionally and
                 financially because you invested a lot of time and money in that person’s growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In addition, he was producing revenue (and profits!). Now that he’s gone, your 
                 production has slowed to a crawl. Everyone
                 else is too busy to take on additional workload, and so overall cash flow has slowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Fix: Develop a deep bench of on-call talent. Always
                 be interviewing. Always be hiring, even when you’re not.
                </p>
                <p><b>Bottom Line</b></p>
                <p>
                 In 2013, I bought my first SaaS business (Pulse). If I’m being completely honest, I 
                 didn’t know how valuable Pulse is for small businesses, especially 
                 agencies. But today, after watching countless
                 businesses fail because they didn’t take the time to manage their cash flow, I get it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Cash builds confidence. We forget the fundamentals until our businesses become top-heavy
                 and fall over. Take some time this week to do an honest audit of your business.
                </p>
                <p>Are you still practicing the fundamentals?</p>
